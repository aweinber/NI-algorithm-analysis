@inproceedings{Kadrovach2002,
abstract = {Swarm behavior as demonstrated by flocks of birds, schools offish, and swarms of insects provide a useful method for im- plementing a distributed network of mobile sensor platforms. Such mobile sensor swarm systems are useful for various search or surveillance activities. Swarm behavior ensures safe separation between swarm members while enforcing a level of cohesion. These two properties, when considered in the context of sensors and wireless communications, provide for low redundancy coverage and a robust and reliable com- munications system. This paper examines particle swarm behavior through simulation with respect to such a sensor network. Analysis of swarm behavior for v"-\~{}rious parameter settings indicate a classification methodology. This provides a foundation for a proposed taxonomy.},
